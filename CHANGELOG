# Top level changes
  * Added setup script, Makefile, environment definitions
  * Added pre-commit functionality.  Right now, I'm ignoring
  original code
  * Added MATS.migration with new code to work with
  * Ran code through flake8, black, etc
  * Changed all mutable default inputs (stuff like variable={})
  To None
  * Changed from passing filenames to passing dataframes
  I personally thing this is a better way to go for pipelining
  Also, I don't like file creation as an unkown side effect
  * Added simple test.  This just tests the final output from some of
  the examples between the original code and the new code
  * Added a new model MATS.exampledata for finding example data from a central location
  * Made changes to some example notebooks to work with changes to
  package structure.
